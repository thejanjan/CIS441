Implement the scanline algorithm for a set of 100 "going up" triangles and fill up the image buffer with their colors.   The image you make should be 1000x1000.  You should assume the "going up" triangles overlap with the pixels and apply the conventions discussed in Lecture 2 -- if a triangle overlaps with the lower left of a pixel, then the pixel should take its color.

You should verify it is correct using the checker script: proj1B_checker Download proj1B_checker.  When you are done, upload your code to Canvas.  Your C file should be named proj1B.c and it should output a file called proj1B_out.pnm.

If your code does not produce exactly the same image on ix-dev, you should expect to get less than half credit. 

What to turn in: Just one file, named either proj1B.c or proj1B.cpp, and it should output a file called proj1B_out.pnm

IMPORTANT: you should use “double” to get double precision (8 byte) floating type. The word “float” should not appear in your code. If you use float, then you will get mostly the right picture, but you will have ~30 pixels wrong.

Some more notes:

1) I began my implementation by figuring out which vertex was which, i.e., which was top, which was bottom-left, and which was bottom-right.

2) Some pixels may be outside the screen. Plan for that.

3) Don’t forget to use double precision and the F441 and C441 functions.

4) Be careful about which quantities you want to be integers and which you want to be double precision.

5) Don't forget about the change of conventions where you adjust the row (see end of lecture 2).

6) What I printed when debugging:

a. The triangle (I added a print method)

b. Which vertices were which (top-left, bottom-left, right)

c. The range of scanlines for a triangle

7) FINALLY: start by working on just a single triangle and get that working entirely. Then try all of the triangles at once. Below are my print statements for triangle 55.

Triangle: (555.000000, 500.000000), (500.000000, 560.000000), (605.000000, 500.000000)
Identified: top = 1, bottom left = 0,  bottom right = 2
